## Description

Blackjack with a **_twist_** at the start.

---

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## Getting Started

The player starts off with one face up card and one face down card and the dealer starts with both cards face down. When a game starts, the player will have the option to switch their unknown face down card for one of the dealer's cards. The player's cards will turn face up and the game will continue like regular Blackjack after the player makes their decision. If the player's cards' value equal 21 then it is a Blackjack and the player wins, if the value of both cards equal higher than 21 or the player stands at a value less than the dealer's then the player loses.
